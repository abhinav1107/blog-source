Ahoy there fellow internet Person.

There is one thing that's common between people with programming backgrounds. [Hello World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program). This is something that gets injected to our DNA. And for rest of our lives we tend to keep using it, consciously or unconsciously. Computers have made me who I am today. So, obviously my first post had to be Hello World.

The intention of starting this blog is just to occupy tiny space on this internet universe, leaving my footprint behind. Sharing anything interesting with this world which I have gathered in my day-to-day life. I hope they are worth reading and someone finds it useful.
